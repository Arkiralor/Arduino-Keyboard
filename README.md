# Arduino-Keyboard
My personal take (and somewhat learning experience) on creating a musical keyboard using an Arduino.

The project uses a Piezo speaker to play a paticular tone for 100ms based on the input provided by six (6) push-buttons. The connections are
standard to the components used, a list of which can be found in the KEYBOARD.CSV file.

The connections between the various components are contained within the KEYBOARD CIRCUIT.BRD file while the Arduino code can be found in 
the KEYBOARD CODE.INO file.

This is a beginner-project and my only intended outcome from this is to help other embedded beginners like me.
